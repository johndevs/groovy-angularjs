# Example application written with Groovy and AngularJS

This application is an example of writing AngularJS applications with Groovy. 

To use this application, you need to first install Gradle.

Then checkout this repository and in the root folder run ``gradle convert`` to convert the Groovy files into Javascript.

Once you have converted the Groovy files into Javascript you can open the application by opening the index.html file inside the src/main/webapp/ folder.

This example is part of the blog post at http://devsoap.com/#!/Writing-AngularJS-applications-in-Groovy

Enjoy!
